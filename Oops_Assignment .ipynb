        "  Ans. OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):\n",
        "\n",
        ">OOP is a programming approach that organizes code into objects, which contain data (attributes) and functions (methods). It helps make programs more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",

        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans. In OOP, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data/variables) and methods (functions/behaviors) that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "    \n",
        "     Ex: class Car: pass\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans. In OOP, an object is an instance of a class.\n",
        "It represents a real-world entity that has its own data (attributes) and can perform actions (methods) defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Ex: my_class = class()\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans. Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Abstraction means showing only the essential features and hiding unnecessary details.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It focuses on what the object does.\n",
        "\n",
        ">Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation means wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It focuses on how the data is protected.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans. Dunder methods are special built-in methods that start and end with two underscores.\n",
        "\n",
        "- They are also called magic methods because they let you define how your objects behave with built-in operations.\n",

        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans. In OOP, Polymorphism means the same function or method which can behave differently depending on the object.\n",

        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",

        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans. A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - It is mainly used to initialize the objects attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In Python the constructor method is always named __init__\n",

        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans. 1.  Class Method:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Defined with @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",

        "2. Static Method:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Defined with @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Doesn't take self (object) or cls (class) as a parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Behaves like a normal function, but its placed inside a class for organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Used when the logic is related to the class but doesn't need instance or class data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Method Overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Method Overriding in OOP happens when a child class provides its own implementation of a method that already exists in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. In Python, the @property decorator is used to turn a method into a property.\n",
        "This lets you access methods like attributes (without using parentheses).\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Polymorphism is important in OOP due to:\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans. In Python, both __str__ and __repr__ are special methods used to define how an object should be represented as a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. __str__()\n",
        "\n",
        "- Purpose: To provide a readable and user-friendly string representation of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It is called when you use print(obj) or str(obj).\n",

        "20. What is the significance of the super()function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent (superclass) inside a child (subclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "- It helps in reusing code and maintaining proper method resolution order when multiple inheritance is involved.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans. Both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define special types of methods inside a class, but they work differently.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans. Polymorphism with Inheritance in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism means same method name but different behavior depending on the object calling it.\n",
        "With **inheritance**, a child class can **override** methods of the parent class, and Python decides at runtime which method to call.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it works:\n",
        "1. Parent class defines a method\n",
        "2. Child class overrides (redefines) the same method\n",
        "3. When called through an object, Python runs the version depending on the object type (runtime polymorphism).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
