        "\n",
        ">OOP is a programming approach that organizes code into objects, which contain data (attributes) and functions (methods). It helps make programs more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",

        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans. In OOP, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data/variables) and methods (functions/behaviors) that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python    \n",
        "     Ex: class Car: pass\n",
        "```\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans. In OOP, an object is an instance of a class.\n",
        "It represents a real-world entity that has its own data (attributes) and can perform actions (methods) defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "\n",
        "  Ans. Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Abstraction means showing only the essential features and hiding unnecessary details.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It focuses on what the object does.\n",
        "\n",
        ">Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation means wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to the data.\n",

        "- It focuses on how the data is protected.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",

        "  Ans. Dunder methods are special built-in methods that start and end with two underscores.\n",
        "\n",
        "- They are also called magic methods because they let you define how your objects behave with built-in operations.\n",

        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans. Inheritance is an object-oriented programming concept in which one class (child/subclass) acquires the properties and methods of another class (parent/superclass).\n",
        "- It helps in code reusability, reduces redundancy, and creates a logical structure between classes.\n",

        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans. A constructor in Python is a special method named __init__() that gets called automatically when an object of a class is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It is used to initialize object properties (variables) with default or user-given values.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Takes cls as the first parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Used when you want to work with class-level data.\n",

        "- Doesn't take self (object) or cls (class) as a parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Behaves like a normal function, but its placed inside a class for organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Used when the logic is related to the class but doesn't need instance or class data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Method Overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Method Overriding in OOP happens when a child class provides its own implementation of a method that already exists in its parent class.\n",

        "13.  What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. In Python, the @property decorator is used to turn a method into a property.\n",

        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Polymorphism is important in OOP due to:\n",

        "\n",
        "1. __str__()\n",
        "\n",
        "- Purpose: To provide a readable and user-friendly string representation of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It is called when you use print(obj) or str(obj).\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans. Polymorphism with Inheritance in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism means same method name but different behavior depending on the object calling it.\n",
        "With **inheritance**, a child class can **override** methods of the parent class, and Python decides at runtime which method to call.\n",

        "How it works:\n",
        "1. Parent class defines a method\n",
        "2. Child class overrides (redefines) the same method\n",
        "3. When called through an object, Python runs the version depending on the object type (runtime polymorphism).\n",
